# Programming and Scripting Project 2018

### Fisher's Iris Data Set Project 2018 


1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
- Fisher's Iris Data Set [1] is a multivariate data set that was introduced by Ronald Fisher [2], a British statistician and biologist. This data set is extremely well known in classification literature. Fisher introduced the Iris data set in his paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis" [3].

The data set contains 50 samples from three species of the Iris flower; Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris verisicolor. Each sample measures 4 components of each Iris flower; sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width [4]. 



2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.
