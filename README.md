# Programming and Scripting Project 2018

### Fisher's Iris Data Set Project 2018 


1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
- Fisher's Iris Data Set [1] is a data set that was introduced by Ronald Fisher [2], a British statistician and biologist. Fisher wrote about this data set in his paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis" [3]

Ronald Fisher
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis



2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.
