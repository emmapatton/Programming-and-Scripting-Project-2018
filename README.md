# Programming & Scripting Project '18 - Fisher's Iris Data Set

## Introduction 
*Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it. (delete this prompt when finished)*
Fisher's Iris Data Set [1] is a multivariate data set that was introduced by Ronald Fisher [2], a British statistician and biologist. This data set is extremely well known in classification literature. Fisher introduced the iris data set in his paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis" [3].

The iris data set contains 3 different species of iris, with 50 samples each; iris setosa, iris virginica and iris verisicolor. 50 samples of each species were recorded and each ssample measures 4 components of each iris flower (in centimetres); sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width [4]. Fisher's data set has been commonly used for testing purposes in areas of computer science [5].


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
The following downloads are required to run this program: 

- **Python** (ref) is a high level programming language .....

https://www.invensis.net/blog/it/benefits-of-python-over-other-programming-languages/ - benefits of Python ... 

- **Anaconda** (ref) is an open source pacakge manager used with Python. It is commonly used in Data Analytics. 
"Anaconda is a free and open source[5] distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related application" (wiki ref). 

- **Visual Studio Code** (ref) is a source code editor that isavaiable on a number of operating systems including Windows, macOS and Linux. Visual studio code is the editor that can be used to run the programmes within this project. 



### Installing 
- Python  - available from: https://www.python.org/downloads/ -  It is recommended that you download the most recent version of Python. Check your operating system.....correct download (reword this). 
- Anaconda - available from: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

### Project Planning / To do:
- Quality Assurance Framework
- For summary: what the data contains, what it's about, background surrounding data, why it is so commonly used in data analytics
- Write code on the data set:
  - summary statistics
  - max value, min value
  - sum of each column
  - mean/average in each column, median
  - spread within the data, standard deviation
  - think about how to represent visually - histogram, table, scatterplot (research this)
 - Break project into smaller tasks 
 - What does the data look like?
 - Sell Python to colleagues using data set 
 - Explain in README how to run program and what it does 
 - Why is this data set interesting? Can refer to more detailed website that analyses data if further description is needed
